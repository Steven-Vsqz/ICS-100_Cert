<h1>FEMA National Incident Management System (NIMS): ICS-100</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Completing the ICS and NIMS course gave me a solid understanding of how emergency response systems work. I learned how the Incident Command System is structured, the roles of key players like the Incident Commander and staff, and how NIMS management principles are applied in different situations. It helped me get a clear picture of how to manage and coordinate incident responses, making sure everything runs smoothly and efficiently during emergencies.
